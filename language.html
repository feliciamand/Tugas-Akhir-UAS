                Asking “What language is spoken in China?” is a bit like asking what language is spoken in Europe — times four. Why? The People's Republic of China is larger than the whole of Europe, with a history just as profuse and old.
                While most European languages were influenced by Latin around 2000 years ago, China had its own influential lingua franca around the same time called Classical Chinese. Scholars and administrators used this language, but it also infiltrated the languages and dialects of the people, creating many local variants. In fact, China is home to 56 ethnic groups who've all played a role in shaping Chinese's many variants.

              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                In a population of roughly 1.4 billion, China has 302 individual living languages. To put that in perspective globally, an astonishing 20% of the world's population speaks some form of a Chinese language natively.
            <br><br>Linguists have divided Chinese into eight to 10 main language groups (which we'll dive into below), with each group having several sub-dialects. Chances are that anyone coming from outside Beijing is bound to speak at least one of these local dialects. Of course, we can't do all 302 languages justice in this article, but let's dive into eight of these main lingual groups.

                <center>Simplified vs. Traditional Chinese—What’s the Difference?</center>
              </p>
            
              <p align="justify">
                With 1.3 billion native speakers, Chinese holds the title of the world’s most widely spoken language. One quarter of the global population speaks some form of Chinese, and this includes 800 million active internet users—making the language hugely relevant to any organization that communicates globally.
            <br><br>
                While the Latin alphabet has a core of 26 letters that can form an entire vocabulary, Chinese consists of tens of thousands of characters (or logograms) that are used to write single- and multiple-character words. Today, there are two different written forms of Chinese: Traditional and Simplified. Traditional Chinese preserves the orthodox characters that have been used for thousands of years. As its name suggests, Simplified Chinese consists of simplified versions of the traditional Chinese characters.
<br><br>
When the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, the literacy rate in China was around 20%. Believing the steep learning curve of Traditional Chinese characters to be a factor, the government launched a campaign to promote literacy and education by simplifying the writing system. Approximately 2,000 traditional characters were modified, primarily by reducing the number of strokes and/or merging the characters. Throughout the 50’s and 60’s, Simplified Chinese was adopted in mainland China, Malaysia, and Singapore, while the people of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau continue to use the Traditional writing system.

              <b>Character structure</b><br>
              Simplified Chinese characters have fewer strokes than their traditional counterparts, and therefore have simpler, less ornate structures.

               <p align="justify">
                When Simplified Chinese was developed, some Traditional characters were merged, so the new language has fewer commonly used characters. While Traditional uses a single character to express a word or part of a word, Simplified may represent multiple words or concepts using the same character.
              <br>  For example, the character 发 in Simplified Chinese equates to either 髮 (hair) or 發 (become/develop) in Traditional Chinese. When writing the phrase 头发发白 (hair turns gray) in Simplified Chinese, the two characters in the middle are identical, but have different meanings. Traditional Chinese represents each word in this phrase with a unique character: 頭髮發白 .

                <center>Vocabulary and Sentence Structure</center>
               </p>

               <p align="justify">
               Simplified and Traditional Chinese have some differences in word choice, vocabulary usage, and character sequences. 
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Here are just a few examples that illustrate how the same word can be represented by completely different characters:                
                </p> 
                <p align="justify">
                -   default :  默认 (Simplified), 預設 (Traditional)
                 </p>
                <p align="justify">
                -   video   : 视频 (Simplified), 影片(Traditional)      
                </p>          
                <p align="justify">
                -   speech  : 讲话 (Simplified), 演說 (Traditional). <br>
                In this example, when the Simplified Chinese usage is put into Traditional Chinese (講話), it means only “to speak,” as a verb, but not “speech,” as a noun.               
                </p>

                <p align="justify">
                These examples show the same word, written with the same two characters, but with the sequence reversed:    
                </p>      
                <p align="justify">
                        -   Authentic   : 地道 (Simplified), 道地 (Traditional)

                <p align="justify">
                    -   Late night supper   : 夜宵 (Simplified), 宵夜 (Traditional)

                <p align="justify">
                    Next, we have an example of two characters that have very different meanings:
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    -   土豆 means potato(es) in Simplified Chinese, but in Traditional, it means peanut(s).

                Each Chinese character represents a monosyllabic Chinese word or morpheme. In 100 CE, the famed Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen classified characters into six categories, namely pictographs, simple ideographs, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. Of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as rén 人 (human), rì 日 (sun), shān 山 (mountain; hill), shuǐ 水 (water). Between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as chōng 沖 (pour), combining a phonetic component zhōng 中 (middle) with a semantic radical 氵 (water). Almost all characters created since have been made using this format. The 18th-century Kangxi Dictionary recognized 214 radicals.

              </div></center>
              Modern characters are styled after the regular script. Various other written styles are also used in Chinese calligraphy, including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants. Singapore, which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the de facto standard for younger ethnic Chinese in Malaysia.            
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              The Internet provides the platform to practice reading these alternative systems, be it traditional or simplified. Most Chinese users in the modern era are capable of, although not necessarily comfortable with, reading (but not writing) the alternative system, through experience and guesswork.[83]
            <br>
              A well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a Mainland newspaper. The PRC government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. School-children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000.[84] A large unabridged dictionary, like the Kangxi Dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.            </p>
