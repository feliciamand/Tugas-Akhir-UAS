                    Chinese people are known as Zhongguoren (simplified Chinese: 中国人; traditional Chinese: 中國人) or as Huaren (simplified Chinese: 华人; traditional Chinese: 華人) by speakers of standard Chinese, including those living in Greater China as well as overseas Chinese.
                    Why do Chinese have 3 names?
                    Until the mid-1900s in China, a person usually had three names besides his or her surname: ming, zi and hao. Ming is the name given by parents; Zi is the name granted to a person at the beginning of adulthood – men usually at the age of 20 and women at 15.

                Did you know what the behaviors of Chinese people are?              
            </p>
              <p align="justify">
                Chinese people prefer modesty and keeping a low profile both in regard to their own achievements and status as well as their interactions with others. Traditionally, in the course of polite conversation, Chinese people will downplay their own positions and achievements while emphasizing those of others.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                The traditional Chinese way of life, in theory, advocates the harmony among the individual, the family and society. In traditional Chinese culture, the family is the basic unit of society, while individuals are only one part of the family. The blood relationship is the most important element of society.                
            </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    <b>Food Habits</b> <br>
                    Chinese daily meals consist of four food groups: grains, vegetables, fruit, and meat. Because of lactose intolerance, Chinese do not consume large amounts of dairy products. Instead, Chinese substitute these with soymilk and tofu, which also contain large amounts of protein and calcium.

                <b>What are the Chinese values? </b>
                The Chinese traditional cultural values of harmony, benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, honesty, loyalty, and filial piety are embodied in China's diplomacy through the concept of harmony, the most important Chinese traditional value.                
               </p>

               <p align="justify">
                <b>How Chinese show their respect? </b>
                In formal situations, people bow slightly or nod politely to greet one another formally. The bow is from the shoulders and should be greater if the person you are greeting has a higher status than you. If seated, the Chinese will stand up out of respect when they are introduced to someone.               </p>
