                In 2010, when President Barack Obama welcomed his Chinese counterpart to a summit in 
                Washington, dc, he greeted him with a handshake and a swift, shallow dip of the head. 
                The image of America’s president bowing before China made an arresting cover photo for 
                the book “Eclipse”, published the following year. The book, written by Arvind Subramanian 
                of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based think-tank, 
                predicted that China would soon come to dominate the world economy and that America 
                could do precious little about it. Your correspondent once included the cover image 
                in a presentation at the Central Party School in Beijing. It caused quite a frisson.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
                To gauge a country’s economic “dominance” Mr Subramanian combined its share of world trade, net capital exports and global gdp (measured at both market exchange rates and purchasing-power parities, which try to correct for international differences in the price of similar goods). He gave each attribute a weight loosely based on the imf’s formula for allocating votes to its members. His index, he argued, successfully captured Britain’s economic hegemony in 1870, its rivalry with Germany in 1913 and its eclipse by America in the subsequent decade.

               It has the world's second largest economy by nominal GDP, totaling around US$18.32 trillion in 2022, and the world's largest economy since 2016 when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). China accounted for 18.6% of global economy in 2022 in PPP terms, and around 18% in nominal terms in 2022.
                </p>

            <p align="justify">
                China's economy has grown to one of the largest and most powerful in the world over the past few decades. Driven by industrial production and manufacturing exports, China's GDP is actually now the largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) equivalence.

            <p align="justify">
                Economists generally attribute much of China's rapid economic growth to two main factors: large-scale capital investment (financed by large domestic savings and foreign investment) and rapid productivity growth. These two factors appear to have gone together hand in hand.

                <b>Lantern Festival<br></b>
               
                <i>Lantern Festival</i>, also called <i> Yuan Xiao Festival</i>, holiday celebrated in China and other Asian countries that honours deceased ancestors on the 15th day of the first month (Yuan) of the lunar calendar. The Lantern Festival aims to promote reconciliation, peace, and forgiveness. The holiday marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year (see Lunar New Year). During the festival, houses are festooned with colourful lanterns, often with riddles written on them; if the riddle is answered correctly, the solver earns a small gift. Festival celebrations also include lion and dragon dances, parades, and fireworks. Small glutinous rice balls filled with fruits and nuts, called yuanxiao or tangyuan, are eaten during the festival. The round shape of the balls symbolizes wholeness and unity within the family.

                The Lantern Festival may originate as far back as the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE), when Buddhist monks would light lanterns on the 15th day of the lunar year in honour of the Buddha. The rite was later adopted by the general population and spread throughout China and other parts of Asia. A legend concerning the festival’s origin tells the tale of the Jade Emperor (You Di), who became angered at a town for killing his goose. He planned to destroy the town with fire, but he was thwarted by a fairy who advised the people to light lanterns across the town on the appointed day of destruction. The emperor, fooled by all the light, assumed the town was already engulfed in flames. The town was spared, and in gratitude the people continued to commemorate the event annually by carrying colourful lanterns throughout the town.
