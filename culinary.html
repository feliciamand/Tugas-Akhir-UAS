              The eight culinary cuisines of China Chinese cuisine is rich and
              diverse, varying in style and taste from region to region. Its
              history dates back thousands of years, evolving according to
              changes in both the environment (such as climate) and local
              preferences over time. Chinese cuisine also varies depending on
              class and ethnic background, and it is often influenced by the
              cuisines of other cultures. All these factors contribute to an
              unparalleled range of cooking techniques, ingredients, dishes and
              eating styles that make up what is understood to be Chinese food
              today. <br><br>
              Of the various regional styles of Chinese cuisine, it is
              the Cantonese cuisine from Guangdong that is the most widely
              recognized globally. Many Western Chinese restaurants have adopted
              a style of Cantonese cooking due to the majority of Chinese
              emigrants from Guangdong who moved to the United States and Europe
              in the 1800s. Indeed, Hakkasan's menu is predominantly Cantonese
              or Hakka (from which Hakkasan derives its name), a cuisine
              developed by the Hakka people who lived within the Guangdong
              province. However, there are a number of distinctive styles from
              different regions that contribute to the whole of Chinese cuisine,
              and of these there are eight specific culinary traditions that are
              recognized throughout Chinese society and around the globe.
              <br><br>
              These eight culinary cuisines are Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan,
              Jiangsu, Shandong, Szechuan and Zhejiang. <br />
              
              
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                <b>   Anhui (Hui)<br></b> 
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/anhui.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Anhui cuisine is derived from the native cooking styles of the people
                located in the Huangshan Mountains region in China. Although it is
                similar to Jiangsu cuisine, there is less emphasis on seafood and
                more on a wide variety of locally grown herbs and vegetables from
                both the land and the sea. <br><br>

                <b>Cantonese (Yu)<br></b>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/cantonese.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Due to Guangdong's proximity to the South China
                Sea, the people of the region have access to a plentiful supply of
                imported food and fresh seafood. Cantonese cuisine incorporates
                almost all edible meats, including chicken feet, duck's tongue,
                snakes and snails. However, due to availability, lamb and goat are
                rarely eaten. Many cooking techniques are used, including wok hei
                (stir frying) and steaming. Spices are used moderately, and fresh
                herbs are seldom added to the food. Dishes include dim sum, small
                morsels of food typically served at breakfast or lunch alongside
                tea; barbequed char siu, sticky and burnt red in color; and clear
                broths flavored with meat stock. <br>
                <br />

                <b>Fujian (Min)<br></b>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/fujian.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Fujian cuisine is influenced by its coastal position
                and mountainous terrain, and ingredients such as woodland
                mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fish, shellfish and turtles are used
                regularly. The cuisine in this area is known to have particular
                emphasis on umami taste; the dishes are notoriously light and
                flavorful.
                <br /><br>
  
                <b>Hunan (Xiang) <br></b> 
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/hunan.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Like Szechuan cuisine, Hunan food is renowned for
                being hot and spicy, with garlic, chili peppers and shallots used
                liberally. However, unlike Szechuan cuisine, it is known for being
                purely hot as opposed to the searing, numbing heat of Szechuan
                cooking.
                <br /><br>
  
                <b>Jiangsu (Su) <br></b>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/jiangsu.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Jiangsu cuisine consists of a several different
                styles of Chinese cooking, namely Huaiyang, Yangzhou, Nanjing,
                Suzhou and Zhenjiang. The food in Jiangsu cuisine is known as
                being soft, but not to the point of falling apart: the meat tastes
                tender but wouldn't separate from the bone when picked up.
                <br /><br>

            <p align="justify">
                <b>Shandong (Lu)  <br></b>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/shan.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Derived from the native cooking styles of Shandong,
                a northern coastal province of China, Shandong cuisine consists of
                two predominant styles: Jiaodong, characterized by light seafood
                dishes; and Jinan, a style that features the use of soup in its
                dishes. Although it is less available in the West, Shandong
                cuisine is often considered one of the most influential styles of
                cooking in the Chinese culinary history.
                <br /><br>
  
                <b>Szechuan (Chuan) <br> </b>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/szezhuan.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                Szechuan cuisine is renowned for its use of bold
                flavors; chili, garlic and Szechuan pepper are used liberally
                throughout the dishes. Szechuan pepper has a unique taste: it is
                intensely fragrant, citrusy and causes a numbing sensation in the
                mouth. Szechuan cuisine often contains food that has been
                preserved through pickling, salting and drying.
                <br /><br>
  
                <b>Zhejiang (Zhe) <br></b>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                    <img src="/assets/image/zhe.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" /></div>
                In general, Zhejiang food is fresh and light rather
                than greasy. It consists of at least four styles of cooking:
                Hangzhou, characterized by the use of rich foods and bamboo
                shoots; Shaoxing, specializing in poultry and fish; Ningbo,
                specializing in seafood; and Shanghai, with xiao long bao.
